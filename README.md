#### Mission statement: 
*To provide digestible information that allows for users to make educated decisions.*

#### Problem statement:
The spread of Covid-19 in the United States has become an unnecessary political issue. Absolute scientific fact is becoming convoluted with personal opinions and misinformation, endangering public health and safety. The nature of the pandemic has further amplified non-vetted voices on digital platforms, making it difficult for citizens to discern between fact and fiction. While many scientific agencies have updated their websites to combat this issue, such as the CDC and John Hopkins University, their platforms either tend to contain too much information on their website as a whole or include too much specific jargon on dedicated pages of text. Because their foremost purposes are to serve as vetted data repositories, they often make it difficult to discern specific information that a user may be looking for. It can be difficult for those with lower literacy rates to quickly navigate and extract key information about the effects of Covid-19 from these websites, further encouraging users to turn towards questionable diet sources, such as Twitter, Facebook, or YouTube. Hence, how can we facilitate the presentation of accurate statistical information about Covid-19 while also making it digestible for and accessible to varying degrees of scientific and language literacy? 


⇒ making statistics more digestible; JHU is too text heavy, requiring users to understand its jargon to fully comprehend its contents, but the CDC website doesn’t provide many statistics or updates - assumes users to take the suggestions and information at face value (CDC = ways to cope with the virus, but not painting a picture of the effects of the virus)

⇒ user group: getting those who are using the CDC website to come to our solution, lower literacy rate (which the CDC does a decent job at addressing, but the JHU one doesn’t)
