#### Mission statement: 
*To provide digestible information that allows for users to make educated decisions.*

#### Problem statement:

The spread of Covid-19 in the United States has become an unnecessary political issue. Absolute scientific fact is becoming convoluted with personal opinions and misinformation, endangering public health and safety. The nature of the pandemic has further amplified non-vetted voices on digital platforms, making it difficult for the average citizen to discern between fact and fiction. While many scientific agencies have either updated their websites to combat this, such as the CDC and John Hoppkins University, their platforms tend to cause information overload, since their foremost purposes are to serve as vetted data repositories. It can be difficult for the average user to quickly navigate and extract key information from these websites, further encouraging users to turn towards questionable diet sources, such as Twitter. Hence, how can we facilitate the presentation of accurate Covid-19 information while also making it digestible for varying degrees of scientific and language literacy?
