## Problem Statement & Research
The Covid-19 pandemic in the United States has become an unnecessary political issue. 

Absolute scientific fact is becoming convoluted with personal opinions and misinformation, endangering public health and safety. The nature of the pandemic has further amplified non-vetted voices on digital platforms, making it difficult for citizens to discern between fact and fiction. While many scientific agencies have updated their websites to combat this issue, such as the CDC and John Hopkins University, their platforms either tend to contain too many meticulous statistics or include too much field-specific jargon within huge blocks of text. Since their foremost purposes are to serve as vetted data repositories, these recognized sources are not catered towards isolating a handful of key insights; rather, they’re organized to contain as many facts as possible. Hence, users with lower health or reading literacy rates may not be able to confidently navigate and extract key information about the effects of Covid-19 from these websites, further encouraging these users to turn towards questionable “diet” sources, such as Twitter, Facebook, or YouTube. 

The issue regarding misinformation and Covid-19 have gotten to the point where the World Health Organization (WHO) has released a formal article explaining the consequences of the mass spread of false materials. The WHO has classified the current situation as an “infodemic”, an overabundance of information, both online and offline (Managing, 2020). While the effects of online misinformation may not be immediately visible, misinformation and disinformation obstructs public health efforts through increasing stigmatization, threatening precious health gains, and endangering countries’ ability to stop the pandemic (Managing, 2020). From a social perspective, false information can also amplify hate speech, democracy, and human rights violations (Managing, 2020). In response, the WHO has begun to encourage “stakeholders, researchers and technologists who can design and build effective strategies and tools to respond to the infodemic” (Managing, 2020). 

Furthermore, Covid-19 is the first pandemic of our digital century. Hence, the intersection of technology, information and public health have never stood at this crossroads together before. In the age of social media, widespread access to conflicting advice and data can result in an “overly informed public”, which can also mean an “uninformed public” (Valika et al., 2020). There is no cure. There is a cure? Herd immunity is the way to go. Social distancing promotes herd immunity? As noted by Valika et al., while there is a significant amount of properly vetted sources and papers available for both public and private consumption, relevant information is easily being “drowned out by the sheer quantity of publications” and bits of information floating around the internet (Valika et al., 2020). No single individual can possess enough cognitive energy to process even a fraction of what’s out there, let alone all the content available. 

So what can people do to hone in on the important key points? Health literacy is “the degree to which patients have the capacity to obtain, process, understand and use health information” (Nayak et al., 2016). Poor health literacy has been associated with greater use of emergency care, hospitalizations, medical non-compliance and morality (Nayak et al., 2016). Unfortunately, it’s estimated that nearly 9 out of 10 Americans have limited health literacy (Nayak et al., 2016). Information overload further inflates this issue, as overload hinders a person’s ability to focus on proper decision making (Crook et al., 2016). One study done by Ji et al. revealed that users could not successfully pick out their previously chosen brand when too many brands were presented, suggesting that increasing amounts of information hinders concentration (Ji et al., 2014). Hence, Ji et al.’s study reflects the idea that people “can only digest a certain amount of information in any given time” (Ji et al., 2014). 

Similarly, Nayak et al.’s study focuses on presenting different types of graphs to users in order to note which types of graphs are best suited for consumer use. Through their study, they found that numeracy and graph literacy were correlated (Nayak et al., 2016). Interestingly, while participants had the highest comprehension scores with iconic graphs, most responded to preferring traditional vertical bar charts (Nayak et al., 2016). Nayak et al.’s discussion highlights how familiarity may play a large role in how easily users absorb information. Making graphical information digestible then requires both following the principles of good visual information design and using familiar concepts to the targeted user group. As Ji et al. mentions,  "there's no such thing as information overload, it's the filter failure”. Hence, how can we facilitate the presentation of accurate statistical information about Covid-19, while also making the content digestible for and accessible for varying degrees of scientific and language literacy? 

## Solution Details 
Our solution centers around creating visualizations that hone in on one or two specific metrics, so that users can quickly draw key conclusions. Visualizations will each include some sort of hover interaction that allows users to view further details about a particular element on a graph, but those descriptions will also be focused on only highlighting one statistic at a time. 

The overall website is split into two sections: one for health insights and another for economic insights. The top navigation bar allows users to switch between these two pages by clicking on the button associated with the page that they would like to view. 

### 1. Infection Timeline Slider
![Infection Timeline](/img/infection_timeline.png "Infection Timeline")
For the top graph on the health effects page, users can drag the slider across the ‘infection timeline’ for both the mild and severe instances, which will elicit a label above the slider that they drag. The label contains information about both the point in time for an infection type, as well as how severe symptoms are for the infected individual. The color scheme of the lines are meant to help users recognize severity at a glance if they do not want to interact with the sliders. Users can drag the sliders back and forth, but the two sliders cannot be dragged at the same time and they are independent of each other. 

### 2. Mortality Rate by Demographic Bar Graph
![Mortality Rate by Demographic Bar Graph](/img/mortality_rate.png "Mortality Rate by Demographic Bar Graph")
Scrolling down, users will see a fairly general mortality rate by demographic horizontal bar chart. Users can click on the drop down to select which demographic they would like to see the mortality rate for. For instance, if a user wants to see the mortality rate for race/ethnicity, they would click on the drop down menu and click on the option for ‘race/ethnicity’. Hovering over any of the bars creates a small popup which details the specific number of deaths belonging to that category. Moving the mouse off of a bar causes the popup to fade out.

For the graph’s content, the x-axis contains categories for the selected demographic and the y-axis represents the percentage of recorded deaths. The default demographic is age, and will be divided into categories as follows: <1, 1-4, 5-14, 15-24, 25-34, etc until 85, at which point the ages will be treated as one grouping. A dropdown menu, placed on the top left of the graph, can be used to select either Sex or Race as other demographic groupings. Sex will only contain male and female, as the provided CDC data makes no additional differentiations. Sorting by Race uses the following categories, as per the CDC data: White, Hispanic, Black, Asian, Other, American Indian or Alsakan Native. All bars present on the graph can be hovered for details as described above.

### 3. Lasting Effects by Pre-Existing Health Conditions Waffle Chart
![Lasting Effects by Pre-Existing Health Conditions Waffle Chart](/img/lasting_effects.png "Lasting Effects by Pre-Existing Health Conditions Waffle Chart")
To the left of the mortality rate by demographic chart, users can similarly interact with a waffle chart that depicts the percentage of people who recover or fail to recover from Covid. Users can access a drop down menu on the top left to sort between different pre-existing categorical groupings, notably hypertension, obesity, psychiatric condition, and immunosuppressive condition. We extracted this list through a CDC article, and decided to only use categories that had a significant p-value, so not all categories in the CDC article are included. The sections of the chart can also be hovered to show their exact numbers. 

### 4. Covid-19 Relief Spent By Country Bar Graph
![Covid-19 Relief Spent By Country Bar Graph](/img/covid_relief.png "Covid-19 Relief Spent By Country Bar Graph")
Clicking on the economic effects button in the navigation bar will take users to a page that contains visualizations for a few key insights into the economic effects of Covid-19. The first graph users will see is a horizontal bar graph concerning how much a handful of countries have spent for Covid-19 relief as a percentage of their overall GDP, according to the BBC. Hovering over a bar shows a label that gives the specific percentage of spending as a percentage of the country’s GDP. When users move their mouse away from the bar, the hovered label will disappear as well.

### 5. US Budget Breakdown Single Bar Chart
![US Budget Breakdown Single Bar Chart](/img/spending_countries.png "US Budget Breakdown Single Bar Chart")
As users scroll down the page on the economic effects tab, there will be a horizontal, single bar chart to represent the breakdown of the United State’s Covid-19 relief spending budget. While the labels with the specific monetary metric is statically listed, users have the ability to hover over the bar to get a clearer definition as to what outlays, obligations, and unobligated mean. Similarly, the estimated lending visualization will also have definitions to explain this highly specific, and generally confusing, jargon. Hovering over will elicit a gray pop-up label, just like the other graphs featured on this website. When users move their mouse away from the particular section of the bar, the pop-up will dissolve into the background.

### 6. Job Loss Word Cloud
![Job Loss Word Cloud](/img/job_loss.png "Job Loss Word Cloud")
Scrolling to the bottom of the economic effects page, users have access to a word cloud visualization that describes the different industries based on the The Urban Institute Data Catalog. At a glance, users can find out which industries have had the most layoffs and hovering over a word will elicit a pop-up label that gives a precise number of jobs lost for the hovered industry. When a user moves their mouse away from their hovered word, the statistical pop-up label will also fade.
